### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michele. I'm a computer engineer and musician, desperately to bring my two souls together.  
Among my interests there are:
* Embedded devices :computer:
* Linux :penguin:
* Opera singing :musical_score:
* Piano :musical_keyboard:   
... and a lot of other things I don't recall right now.  

Feel free to take a look at my [**resume**](MichelePerrone_Resume.pdf).
