### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michele and I'm Italian (before you ask: yes, I make pizza :pizza:). I'm a computer engineer and musician, desperately trying to bring my two souls together.  
Among my interests there are:
* Embedded devices :computer:
* Linux :penguin:
* Opera singing :musical_score:
* Piano :musical_keyboard:
* World takeover :rocket:

Feel free to take a look at my [**resume**](MichelePerrone_Resume.pdf).
