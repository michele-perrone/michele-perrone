### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michele and I'm Italian. Apart from making pizza :pizza:, I'm also a computer engineer and a musician, desperately trying to bring these two souls together.  
Among my interests there are:
* Embedded devices :computer:
* Linux :penguin:
* Opera singing :musical_score:
* Piano :musical_keyboard:
* World takeover :rocket:
